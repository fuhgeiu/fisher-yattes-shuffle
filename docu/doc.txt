header

    header to contain all algorithims in funciton, pass in an array and each func can be called from benchmark

target files

    base cpp file to run functions without the use of benchmark

    benchmark cpp file to run fucntions and benchmark them

    in each benchmark and base create arrays of varius size and pass those in

 notes

    how to pass in a number in the benchmark so i dont need to create and fill an array

        or in the header file call funtion

        int* func (length) {

            create array [length]

            fill the array in with numbers in a sequential pattern 1 -> length

           return ptr to allocated array
        }



   structure

    in header

        def func to create array

        def func of algorithims


    in core file

        func run(flag to show array) create func for each algorithim

            func to create array and return ptr

            func algorithim (this will be called when benchmark), use one of the algorithims

            if (flag) print array

            delete ptr


    in base main

        func run(length of array,flag to show array)


    in benchmark main

        benchmark

            func (length of array)
